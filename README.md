# Tic Tac Toe LLD Challenge ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Low-Level Design repository! ðŸŒŸ

## Overview
This project aims to implement the classic game of Tic Tac Toe with a focus on clean, efficient, and extensible design. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this LLD challenge provides an exciting opportunity to dive into the world of game design.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: We've meticulously crafted the game using object-oriented principles. Explore the classes and their interactions in the codebase.
- **Modular Components**: The game logic, board representation, and player management are neatly separated. Feel free to extend or modify any component.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Play the game directly from your terminal. Run `make` and then `./play` to start a match.
- **Customizable Board Size**: Want a 4x4 board? No problem! Adjust the board size easily.
- **Winning Strategies**: The game supports both traditional 3-in-a-row and more challenging variations (like 4-in-a-row).
